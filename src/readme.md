This application represents the database functionality 
of the Restaurant COVID Survey application. The application
processes data created from different CSV files and processes each row into their respective data objects that reflect the 
MySQL entities. Once these data objects are created, each object is put into the
repository of their respective class which inserts each object into the MySQL 
database. Afterwards, the application will run a method which will
search through the database to find confirmed recorded COVID cases and
outputs the COVIC positive customers and employees as well as those who were
present inside the restaurant as well.
